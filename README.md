## Hosts that don't play nice

You should probably avoid these. It doesn't mean it's not possible, but will likely require support tickets to enabled PHP modules like `mcrypt`, `mbstring`, and so on.

- [Go Daddy](http://godaddy.com) - doesn't meet server requirements
- [NameCheap](http://namecheap.com)
- [Rackspace Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/) - issues with out-of-sync file timestamps and permissions
- [1and1.com](http://1and1.com) - please see [issue raised](https://github.com/statamic/hosts/issues/12) for more details.

## Standard Dev Environments

Wide-spread dev environments that work well (e.g. MAMP)

- [MAMP 3](http://www.mamp.info/en/) (*MAMP 2 works as well*)
- A [Vagrant for Statamic](https://github.com/bradleyflood/vagrant-statamic) setup
