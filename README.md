## Hosts that don't play nice

- [NameCheap](http://namecheap.com)
- [Rackspace Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/) - issues with out-of-sync file timestamps and permissions
- [1and1.com](http://1and1.com) - please see [issue raised](https://github.com/statamic/hosts/issues/12) for more details.
